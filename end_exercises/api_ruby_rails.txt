After looking through a few Ruby/Rails API's, I found that api.rubyonrails.org was the one I liked the most.  The first thing I noticed about this resource was a side-bar with a searchable index of rails classes on the home page.  This meant that I could see an overview of the rails framework and find the necessary querry, immediately, without having to find a new index page. There are also no distracting graphics or adds, meaning my eyes can easily find the information I am looking for without having to sift through extra details.
